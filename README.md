# Enhanced Detection of Camouflaged Soldiers in Natural Environments Using YOLO11

## Project Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based approach to detect camouflaged soldiers in natural environments using the **YOLO11** model. The research is aimed at enhancing the capability of military surveillance systems to identify soldiers who are well-camouflaged within various natural backgrounds. The application of this detection model is critical for military operations, providing real-time threat recognition and response.

By leveraging a custom dataset tailored for military scenarios, this project demonstrates YOLO11's potential to detect camouflaged objects even in complex natural settings. Our research highlights YOLO11's accuracy improvements over other models in camouflage object detection (COD) tasks, which are essential for autonomous surveillance, threat assessment, and response.

## Dataset Description
The custom dataset used for this project contains images featuring camouflaged soldiers across a variety of natural environments. This dataset is structured as follows:

| Dataset Split  | Number of Images |
|----------------|------------------|
| Training Set   | 140              |
| Validation Set | 23               |
| Test Set       | 12               |

The dataset images include detailed annotations marking the locations and contours of camouflaged soldiers to ensure accurate detection.

## Model and Methodology
The project uses the **YOLO11** object detection model, which is trained on our custom dataset to enhance detection in military surveillance scenarios. The workflow includes:

1. **Environment Setup**: Installing necessary dependencies, libraries, and tools.
2. **Data Preparation**: Custom dataset creation, including annotation and augmentation.
3. **Model Training**: Training YOLO11 on the dataset to identify camouflaged soldiers.
4. **Validation and Testing**: Assessing model accuracy on validation and test images.
5. **Real-World Simulation**: Testing the model with new images from the internet that simulate realistic conditions.


## Key Features
- **YOLO11 Implementation**: Employing a state-of-the-art deep learning model to handle complex camouflage detection tasks.
- **Custom Dataset**: A focused dataset with realistic military scenarios, including various camouflage techniques.
- **Improved Detection Accuracy**: Demonstrated superior accuracy compared to previous models in the detection of camouflaged soldiers.
